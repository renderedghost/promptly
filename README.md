# Promptly for ChatGPT

* Search for your Prompt by **Title**.
* Click the **Title** to insert it into the message composer on "https://chat.openai.com".

### 3. Edit a Prompt

* Open the extension from the browser toolbar.
* Click `Edit` to modify the title and content of the selected prompt OR press `Delete` to remove it completely.
